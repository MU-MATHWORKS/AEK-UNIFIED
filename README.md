# **Welcome!**

The following material is aimed at engineering students who want to acquire
different skills through the use of the Arduino Engineering Kit -three
challenging engineering projects- and the MATLAB, Simulink and Stateflow
applications. The available material has been designed in collaboration between
Mondrag√≥n University and MathWorks.

# **RESOURCES**

## **Academic Material**

This repository contains educational material with explanations of basic physics
concepts and practical exercises to test the newly acquired skills.

Also, we have also put at your disposal a Gitbook page. This Gitbook will consist 
of an explanation of the collaboration done between Mondragon Unibertsitatea and 
MATHWORKS, where the Arduino Engineering Kit, onwards AEK, was used in order to 
makes changes in the lectures imparted in the aforemencioned university:

## **Miscellaneous Material**

In this repository you can find different resources, such as videos of the 
different models in operation.

## **AEK Motorcycle Development**

In this repository you can find a series of scripts and models that will help 
you understand how the motorcycle works.
Two models are delivered, the first of them seeks to achieve the balance of 
the motorcycle and the second tries to maintain the balance while it moves on the plane.

## **AEK Rover Development**

In this repository you can find a series of scripts and models that will help
you understand how the rover works. This includes the scripts needed to calibrate
and locate the rover. 
Of course, you will find a fully functional model to command the rover.

## **AEK Drawing Robot Development**

In this repository you can find a series of scripts that will allow you to start
the drawing robot, and as you complete each task you will learn new concepts.
