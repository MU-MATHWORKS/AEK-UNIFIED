# Webcam controlled rover

The following material is aimed at engineering students who want to acquire
different skills through the use of the Arduino Engineering Kit -three
challenging engineering projects- and the MATLAB, Simulink and Stateflow
applications. The available material has been designed in collaboration between
Mondrag√≥n University and MathWorks.

In this repository you can find a series of scripts and models that will help
you understand how the rover works. This includes the scripts needed to calibrate
and locate the rover. 
Of course, you will find a fully functional model to command the rover.
