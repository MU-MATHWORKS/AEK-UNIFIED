# Drawing robot

The following material is aimed at engineering students who want to acquire
different skills through the use of the Arduino Engineering Kit -three
challenging engineering projects- and the MATLAB, Simulink and Stateflow
applications. The available material has been designed in collaboration between
Mondrag√≥n University and MathWorks.

In this repository you can find a series of scripts that will allow you to start
the drawing robot, and as you complete each task you will learn new concepts.
